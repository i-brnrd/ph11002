## PH11002 : 'Links Page'

It can be really useful when presenting work (via poster or powerpoint) to signpost your readers to the content that you wanted to include, but just couldn't. 
I found some of the commerical offerings a little messy (like linktree and similar) so made my own very simple version. 



This is a quick tutorial that we can go through together; in class. 
In two parts: one is make the site, the second, make the QR code. 

### Sign up for Github 
(if you haven't already)

Mine is @i-brnrd; I don't have many followers and haven't really got much on show but it's a vital part of my workflow. 


##### We will do all of this together.... 
##### ....but if you want, give it a go beforehand!
So- sign up to github. Use a decent username you are happy to give out to people in a professional setting. M

Also; open another tab; and navigate to: https://github.com/i-brnrd/ph11002/ - it's these files you see here that are all you need to make a website (apart from the readme...)


1) start a new repository- call it whatever you like but I suggest 'links'. Ignore most of the instructions but under Quick Setup, click the link to 'Get started by creating a new file'.

It'll take you to something that looks like a text editor. 

In your other tab, click on my index.html; copy the file and paste it into your text editor. Call the file index.html and then click commit changes.

2) You have done your first git commit. Well done. 

3) Now navigate (via menu at the top) to Settings. On the left, head to Pages. Under Branch, select Main, and Save. 

4) You've deployed your first page! Well done. This can take a few mins to trickle through to the world wide web. 

5) How does it look? Ugly? well, thats because it's missing styling rules. Go back to the repo; click 'add file' and then select create file. Repeat instruction (1) usig my styles.css; and click commit.

6) Make it suit you. Change it. Change the colours. Swap out the fonts. Change the links. 




### QR Code

Apologies, this part might be a little more difficult as involves python packages but we will give it a try and if it doesn't work, I'm sorry we can do it on my computer for you; I'll still show you how. 


Install https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/ and use your deployment address (mine is https://i-brnrd.github.io/ph11002/ so it goes like user.github.io/repo) to make a qr- you can totally use commerical online qr makers too but now I can do this I don't know which one is good; but this one https://pssweb.manchester.ac.uk/tools/qrcode/ offered by Manchester seems safe enough.
